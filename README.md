You only get it as an input in the console. -->


<!--- FORMAT IS AS FOLLOWS:
1.Make a dice roller
  1.You will accept inputs in the form NdM, and you will return a sum of all the dice rolls.
  2.For reference, N is the number of rolls, and M is the number of sides on the die.
  3.Challenge inputs: 5d12, 6d4, 1d2, 1d8, 3d6, 4d20, 100d100

   Problem 2
  ------
  Make a program that will take a sentence as input, and will remove any vowels it finds. It will then print the sentence without the vowels.

3. Additive Persistence:
  3. Get a number as input.
  4. Sum its digits together.
  5. Repeat this process until there is only one number, and return it.
4. Word Rectangles:
  7. Get a word, a width, and a height as input. Print a corresponding rectangle made of the word. Examples below.
  8. Input: "REKT", width=1, height=1
  9. Output:
  10. R E K T
  11. E     K
  12. K     E
  13. T K E R
  14. Input: "REKT", width=2, height=2
  15. Output:
  16. T K E R E K T
  17. K     E     K
  18. E     K     E
  19. R E K T K E R
  20. E     K     E
